# TheBadShopLog

This is a whole C#/ASP.NET Template website that was designed as a negative review site. Orginally it was created for a university assignment for a course that is introductory for C# programming (INFO102). In addition to meeting the requirements of the assignment I also added a bonus idea (for extra marks) where it has a admin control panel which allows you to control posts and users.
